# Kidney-Stone-and-Simpson-s-Paradox-using-R
Use logistic regression to determine which treatment procedure is more effective for kidney stone removal.

##DataSet
In this project, you will work with medical data published in 1986 in "The British Medical Journal" 
where the effectiveness of two types of kidney stone removal treatments (A - open surgery and B - percutaneous nephrolithotomy) 
were compared.

The dataset used in this project is simulated based on the original medical paper published: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1339981/

## Description

**There exists 1 IPYNB file that:**
1. Reads Data.
2. Installs and loads required libraries.
3. Performs Data Visualization - Plot Bar Graph
4. Identifies and confirms lurking variable
5. Generates Insights

**Guidelines**
1. To open .ipynb file, download jupyter notebook app for your PC.
2. Download from : https://jupyter.org/ OR 
visit: https://jupyter.org/try and click on Try Jupyter with R and open the downloaded file.

3. The End part where we are supposed Generate Insights:
Answers to those:
Is small stone more likely to be a success after controlling for treatment option effect? - Yes
Is treatment A significantly better than B? - No
